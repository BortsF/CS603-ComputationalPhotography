The code is the submission for the Assignment 7 of the course Computational Photography.
The results can be checked in the ‘./results’ folder
The dataset used in the code can be accessed at ‘./dataset’ folder.

QUESTION:
a) Implement seam carving algorithm to delete and insert certain number of rows and columns optimally from a given image in a content aware manner. b) Use appropriate energy measure and delete the object which is not of interest from the given image.

RUN:
To run the code, add this folder to your path in MATLAB and run ‘submission.m’
The figures of the posed questions will be generated
The code is compatible to MATLAB versions R2014b or above.
The object removal can be run at own interest but the results will take time to generate. For convenience, the generated results are placed in the './results' folder.

Results:
Image reduction and enlargement are done and kept in the results folder.



Acknowledgments:
The dataset is taken with the help of Sai Ramana Reddy. I would like to acknowledge that the algorithm is implemented from the paper Avadin and Shamir., 2007.
