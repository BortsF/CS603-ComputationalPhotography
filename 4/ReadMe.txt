The code is the submission for the Assignment 4 of the course Computational Photography.
The results can be checked in the ‘./results’ folder
The dataset used in the code can be accessed at ‘./panorama’ folder.

QUESTION:
Capture 10 overlapping photographs of a static scene which is far from your camera. Stitch them to make a panorama/mosaic of the scene to depict extended field of view in a single photograph.

RUN:
To run the code, add this folder to your path in MATLAB and run ‘submission.m’
The figure of the panoramic view of the 11 input images is created.
The code is compatible to MATLAB versions R2014b or above.

Results:
Panorama view of the whole dataset.

Acknowledgments:
Cameras used for creating the dataset is 5MP, CarlZeiss Lens of Microsoft phones. I would like to acknowledge that the knowledge of the functions related to creating a panoramic view(imref2d, vision.AlphaBlender, imwarp, step) by combining input images has been known from the online mathworks documentation.
