The code is the submission for the Assignment 8 of the course Computational Photography.
The results can be checked in the ‘./results’ folder
The dataset used in the code can be accessed at ‘./dataset’ folder.

QUESTION:
Given an image, obtain the cartoon version (abstraction) of the image using bilateral filtering.

RUN:
To run the code, add this folder to your path in MATLAB and run ‘submission.m’
The figures of the original image and its output when Bilateral Filter is applied will be generated in the first window and the final cartoon(abstract) image of the original one will be generated in the second window.
You can test on different images of dataset by changing the ‘str’ parameter in the ‘submission.m’ file.
The code is compatible to MATLAB versions R2014b or above.

For convenience, the generated results are placed in the './results' folder.

Results:
Cartoon image of the given image.



Acknowledgments:
The dataset is taken from online and some are my personal photography. I would like to acknowledge that the algorithm is implemented from the paper “Holger Winnemoller, Sven C. Olsen, and Bruce Gooch. Real-Time Video Abstraction. In Proceedings of ACM-SIGGRAPH, 2006”.
