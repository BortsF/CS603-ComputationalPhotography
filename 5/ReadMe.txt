### Author: Sri Raghu Malireddi
The code is the submission for the Assignment 5 of the course Computational Photography.
The results can be checked in the ‘./results’ folder
The dataset used in the code can be accessed at ‘./dataset’ folder.

QUESTION:
Given two images, create a seamless composite image using Laplacian compositing and Poisson image editing.

RUN:
To run the code, add this folder to your path in MATLAB and run ‘submission.m’
The figures of the laplacian and poisson composite of the original two images are generated.
The code is compatible to MATLAB versions R2014b or above.

Results:
Poission image composite and Laplacian image composite of two input images

Acknowledgments:
The dataset is taken from online. I would like to acknowledge that some part of the implementation has been understood from the online mathworks documentation related to laplacian pyramid generation.
