The code is the submission for the Assignment 9 of the course Computational Photography.
The results can be checked in the ‘./results’ folder
The dataset used in the code can be accessed at ‘./datasets’ folder.

QUESTION:
Given a set of multi-exposure images of a static scene captured using a static camera, design an approach to generate HDR image of the scene and estimate the camera response function. Tone map the HDR image using bilateral filter for display.

RUN:
To run the code, add this folder to your path in MATLAB and run ‘submission.m’
The figures of the final HDR tone mapped image of the given LDR images is formed.
The code is compatible to MATLAB versions R2014b or above.

If you would like to generate results on your dataset, please change the directory name where you are keeping the images and their respective exposure times into the name_folder and exposure variables respectively.
For convenience, the generated results are placed in the './results' folder.

Results:
HDR image of given LDR images.
